# Studio Legale Bocchietti

`Studio Legale Bocchietti` is a law firm based in Como, Italy.
This repository contains the source code for their official website, which serves as a digital presence for the firm, showcasing their services, team, and latest updates.


## Website Overview

The core infrastructure of the website relies on the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) framework, a robust PHP framework for building web applications.
The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

Despite being a classical frontend-pure website, a live connection to the GoogleDrive API is established to fetch and display the latest documents from the firm's Google Drive.
This allows for real-time updates and ensures that visitors always have access to the most current information such as updated legal documents, pubblications, curricula, and more.
